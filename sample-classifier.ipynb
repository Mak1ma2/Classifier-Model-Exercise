    "- Classifier vs Regressor? A: It's easier to understand the difference between a classifier model and a regressor model based on their general purpose. For classifier model the user wishes to input values into models to \"classify\" them to a certain label (ex: trained models using colors of the rainbow -> input light red -> model should output red (model classified \"light red\" as red <-- an already established label)). For regressor model the user wishes to input values into models to predict the future values (ex: trained models using values of shipments that flows through one warehouse -> input future dates -> model should output predicted values of shipments that'll pass through throughout the inputted dates).
